				<h2>AR & VR</h2>
				<h4>A-Frame</h4>
				<p>A-Frame is a framework that can be used to build virtual reality experiences. It works on both desktop and mobile, and works with coding languages like HTML. I completed part 1 of the A-Frame assignment.</p><br />
				<hr><br style="clear: both;"/>
				<p><iframe width="384" height="216" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_i1uUvOn8I0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen align="right"></iframe><h4>Exercise 2.6</h4>Exercise 2 was all about creating different shapes. For part 6 of this exercise I was tasked with creating at least three different shapes with different colors, positions and rotations.<br />
				I made a box, ring, sphere and plane. The VR experience can be viewed <a href="https://larstalsma.github.io/aframe/02Shape/" target="_blank">here</a>, or check the video.</p><br style="clear: both;"/><br />

I first learned how to animate an object using A-Frame, after which part 7 went in on animating through JavaScript. You can see the result <a href="https://larstalsma.github.io/aframe/04Animation/" target="_blank">here</a>, or watch the video. </p><br style="clear: both;"/><br />
				<hr><br style="clear: both;"/>
				<h4>Unreal Engine</h4>
				<p>Unreal is a widely used game engine in which all kinds of games and virtual environments can be created. I completed both parts 1 and 2 of the assignment, which taught me the very basics of the Unreal Engine.</p><br />
				<hr><br style="clear: both;"/>
				<p><iframe width="384" height="216" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/j8zw9WBAoN0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen align="right"></iframe><h4>Part 1</h4>In this part of the assignment I was introduced to Unreal’s interface, learned how to import assets, put a texture on a 3D model by creating a material, connecting several nodes, creating blueprints as well as a turntable, and finally made a 3D model spin. Watch the video to see my process.</p><br style="clear: both;"/><br />

I primarily used blueprints to do numerous things, such as setting up a camera, creating a controllable pawn, setting up inputs and creating items that disappear upon touch. Check the video for the full development process.</p><br style="clear: both;"/>

				<h2>Arduino</h2>
				<p>Arduino is an open-source electronics platform based on easy-to-use hardware and software. Arduino boards are able to read inputs - light on a sensor, a finger on a button, or a Twitter message - and turn it into an output - activating a motor, turning on an LED, publishing something online. You can tell your board what to do by sending a set of instructions to the microcontroller on the board. To do so you use the Arduino programming language (based on Wiring), and the Arduino Software (IDE), based on Processing (<a href="https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/Introduction" target="_blank">source</a>).<br /><br />
				I was tasked with the completion of the Arduino manual, divided in three parts. From here on you will find numerous exercises from the manual.</p><br />

				<hr><br style="clear: both;"/>
				<p><iframe width="384" height="216" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gPb-XYejj38" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen align="right"></iframe><h4>Exercise 4C</h4>For exercise 4C I was supposed to extend the provided Arduino code, so that one LED would slowly fade in as the other LED would slowly fade out.</p><br style="clear: both;"/><br />
				<hr><br style="clear: both;"/>
				<p><iframe width="384" height="216" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fJ8NuCtwGpc" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen align="left"></iframe><h4>Exercise 6C</h4>Exercise 6C was quite similar to the previous exercise 4C, but in this case I had to add a potentiometer and control the LEDs through it. Once again, one LED was to fade in while the other faded out.</p><br style="clear: both;"/><br />
				<hr><br style="clear: both;"/>
				<p><iframe width="384" height="216" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eXCBzlq6kwY" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen align="right"></iframe><h4>Exercise 7C</h4>For this exercise, I’d be using the 8x8 LED matrix. I connected the potentiometer to it and was tasked with changing the display depending on the value given by the potentiometer.</p><br style="clear: both;"/><br />
				<hr><br style="clear: both;"/>
				<p><iframe width="384" height="216" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YHrYjm9YuEA" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen align="left"></iframe><h4>Exercise 9B</h4>Exercise 9B was all about sound. I had to expand the provided code so that it would play a creative melody.</p><br style="clear: both;"/><br />
				<hr><br style="clear: both;"/>
				<p><iframe width="384" height="216" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wU8yAwn_n04" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen align="right"></iframe><h4>Exercise 9D</h4>For exercise 9D I would be making an instrument a lot like the theremin. The speaker would produce a constant tone depending on the amount of incoming light from the LDR sensor.</p><br style="clear: both;"/><br />
				<hr><br style="clear: both;"/>
				<p><iframe width="384" height="216" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UuAV_5ykzoE" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen align="left"></iframe><h4>Exercise 10D</h4>For exercise 10D I was tasked with determining the threshold value of the NTC or temperature sensor, after which the LED would turn off when the sensor value was lower then the threshold value.</p><br style="clear: both;"/><br />
				<hr><br style="clear: both;"/>
				<p><iframe width="384" height="216" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fHD93LNbbzI" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen align="right"></iframe><h4>Exercise 11D</h4>For exercise 11D I was supposed to make a social distance indicator, using the ultrasonic proximity sensor and three different colored LEDs, that would function as a traffic light. If anything was closer than 1.40m, the red LED would turn on. If anything was between 1.40m and 1.60m away, the yellow LED would turn on. And the same goes for the green LED if anything was farther away than 1.60m.</p><br style="clear: both;"/><br />
				<hr><br style="clear: both;"/>
				<p><iframe width="384" height="216" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pyMFqBYb_y8" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen align="left"></iframe><h4>Exercise 12E</h4>For exercise 12E I was to combine Arduino and Processing. I had to adjust the provided code to use the potentiometer sensor in an interesting way. I chose to use Arduino’s potentiometer value for changing the color of a square in Processing. I ran into some trouble setting up the serial port in processing. I eventually got it to work by using serialIndex, rather than a set value.</p><br style="clear: both;"/><br />

Both buttons were to turn on the same LED when pushed individually.</p><br style="clear: both;"/><br />
				<hr><br style="clear: both;"/>
				<p><iframe width="384" height="216" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/g2qBaT6hhGw" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen align="left"></iframe><h4>Exercise 14C</h4>Exercise 14C got into the usage of the servomotor. I had to set up the servomotor as output and the potentiometer as input. I remapped the incoming value of the potentiometer to be able to match the servomotor’s turning radius.</p><br style="clear: both;"/><br />

				<h2>Processing</h2>
				<p>Processing is a programming language and is somewhat similar to the code I used for Arduino. However, Processing can be used to program interactive images and animations. It runs on Java, but is easier and faster to learn and use than the Java language. The workshop comprised of four larger exercises, each divided into parts.</p><br />
				<hr><br style="clear: both;"/>
				<p><h4>Exercise 2F</h4>For exercise 2F I wrote a program that draws three different elliptical shapes, with different fill and stroke colors.<br />
				<br style="clear: both;"/>
				<img src="images/kring.jpg" alt="K-rings with NFC technology" align="right"><pre><code>

				</code></pre></p><br />
				<hr><br style="clear: both;"/>
				<p><h4>Exercise 2I</h4>Exercise 2I required me to draw four different shapes. I coded a line, triangle, quad and rectangle, again using different colored fills and strokes.<br />
				<br style="clear: both;"/>
				<img src="images/kring.jpg" alt="K-rings with NFC technology" align="right"><pre><code>

				</code></pre></p><br />
				<hr><br style="clear: both;"/>
				<p><h4>Exercise 2O</h4>For exercise 2O, I was tasked with drawing at least two different shapes with various colors. They also had to be interactive. I made four lines and one circle, which, depending on the position of the mouse on the X and Y axes would change color and, in case of the lines, stroke weight.<br />
				<br style="clear: both;"/>
				<iframe width="480" height="270" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/q9nShP9k6K0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen align="right"></iframe><pre><code>

				</code></pre></p><br />
				<hr><br style="clear: both;"/>
				<p><h4>Exercise 3B</h4>Exercise 3 was about computer vision. By using both the OpenCV and Video libraries in Processing, I’d be able to track faces and facial features, to then enhance it with different shapes and elements. Exercise 3B specifically tasked me with putting a black bar over the eyes upon recognizing a face, as well as give that face a red nose.<br />
				<br />
				I ran into quite some trouble setting up the camera, getting the LiveCam to work, and even to get the FaceDetection to work. Processing kept giving me the error that the Cascade failed to load. I wasn’t able to fix the issues with either the LiveCam or FaceDetection, so I eventually decided to move on.<br />
				<br />
				I did however try to write the code that would effectively do what I wanted it to, if either the LiveCam or FaceDetection would’ve worked. I added the corresponding code, although I didn’t get to test it.<br />
				<br style="clear: both;"/>
				<pre><code>

				</code></pre></p><br />
				<hr><br style="clear: both;"/>
				<p><h4>Exercise 3D</h4>The same goes for exercise 3D. For this exercise I had to enhance a recognized face using an image. I wanted to put a lollipop in the recognized face’s mouth by specifically tracking the mouth and inserting a lollipop image in the code. I added the code for this exercise as well, but once again I didn’t get to test if it actually works.<br />
				<br style="clear: both;"/>
				<pre><code>

				</code></pre></p><br />
				<hr><br style="clear: both;"/>
				<p><h4>Exercise 4B</h4>Exercise 4 combined Processing with Arduino, and taught me the possibilities when the two are combined. Exercise 4A provided me with example code, which turned on an LED on the Arduino when I put my mouse over a square drawn with Processing. Now, exercise 4B required me to make a new combination between the two programs.<br />
				<br />
				I changed the example code as follows. Programming still draws a square, although slightly bigger. Upon clicking the square, instead of hovering over it, it turns red. Meanwhile, a signal gets sent to the Arduino, which then displays the message “Hi” on the 8x8 LED matrix I set up on the Arduino side. As long as the square in Programming keeps being pressed, the LED matrix will display the message. Check the video and corresponding code below!<br />
