				<h1>Playful Interactions</h1>
				<p>As seen in the lecture, people are often experience a much higher motivation than usually when one implements playful interfaces and interactions. When something’s (made) fun, people tend to choose hard over easy way more often. Take the ‘piano stairs’ shown in the lecture. Far more people took the stairs over the escalator that day, simply because it was more fun.</p>

				<h2>Assignment</h2>
				<h4>New Playful Interaction Concept</h4>
				<p><img src="images/airport.png" alt="Meet, Greet & Discover concept interface at an airport" align="right">The concept I came up with is called Meet, Greet & Discover. Waiting at an airport can be tedious. Shopping for colognes and magazines,  or simply getting lunch just won’t kill as much time as you’d like. What if you can prepare for your stay, with real life people, at the airport?<br />
				The Meet, Greet & Discover concept is a system with which travelers can discover more about their destinations while waiting to go there. Travelers can select their country or region of destination. Then, if available, they are paired up with someone from that particular country or region, with whom they can chat about what to do, see, visit, try and taste during their stay. No more boring travel guides, but real information and suggestions from those who know all about your destination: the people that actually live there! An example of what the interface could look like, can be seen on the right.<br /><br />
				The user will select the country of destination, whereafter the system will pair them up with someone from that destination, who can tell the user all about wherever they’re travelling. Now, the system works both ways. It will also ask the user to provide information about their country and city of residence, so that two users can be paired up. Users will get notified through their cell phone when an appropriate Meet, Greet & Discover partner has been found. They will then both be guided to a certain location at the airport, where the Meet, Greet & Discover will take place.<br /><br />
				<ul>
					<li>The play modus will be multiplayer</li>
					<li>It will naturally be a cooperative ‘game'</li>
					<li>The concept will use both parallel exertion and interdependent exertion</li>
					<li>Parallel exertion through sub-category knowing</li>
					<li>Interdependent exertion through sub-categories shared object and shared space</li>
					<li>The input technologies will be sight (as in display) and touch (as in selection)</li>
					<li>The output technologies will be sight, sound and speech</li>

				<h2>Research</h2>
				<p>An interesting interactive and playful interface, which I helped design, is the ‘Beweegvloer’. This loosely translates to, and hereafter to be called, ‘Move Floor’. The idea behind this was to teach young children (ages 2 to 4) skills like math, recognition and language. It worked based on a projection coming from the ceiling, which would project all sorts of games on to the floor. The children would then play the game, whilst learning a different variety of skills. The company <i>SpringLab</i>, in association with The Hague University’s <i>Lectorate Healthy Lifestyle in a Stimulating Learning Environment</i>, were developing the Move Floor, as well as an app and interface with which to control the Move Floor. That’s where my project team and I played our part. We did research to determine the user needs, made personas, a site map, sketches and a style guide to help us through the design process, and we then started building prototypes. This all led to the following interface as hi-fi prototype:<br /><br />
				<img style="margin-left: 5em; margin-right: 5em;" src="images/moveFloor1.png" alt="The interface of the Move Floor" align="middle">
				<img src="images/moveFloor2.png" alt="The interface of the Move Floor" align="middle">
				</p><br />
				<p>
				<ul>
					<li>The input technology will be touch (as for the interface) and computer vision (webcam) for the Move Floor itself</li>
					<li>The output technology will be sight (movement of projections) and sound</li>
					<li>The Move Floor can be used as single player as well as multiplayer application, where multiplayer has the preference</li>
					<li>The games which can be played are all focused on being cooperative</li>
					<li>Parallel exertion through knowing (and, in some cases or games, matching as well)</li>
					<li>Interdependent exertion through shared space and primarily through shared body</li>
					<li>More information on the project can be found <a href="https://springlab.nl/peuterpakket/" target="_blank">here</a></li>

				<h2>Reflect</h2>
				<p>I found this topic and the lecture to be quite interesting. I did not expect playfulness to have such a large impact on changing human behavior for the better! I really liked the examples that were given in the lecture and am intrigued by the real-life applications of Playful Interfaces, such as the piano stairs.<br /> 
				As for the future of Playful Interfaces, I expect to see more applications of it in our daily lives. If these playful interactions can be integrated into our lives without the general public noticing all too much, this can really change behavior positively. I am excited to see what’s in store in the future.<br /> 
				The subject exceeded my expectations, most particularly because of the real-life applications that this subject offers. I initially thought that it would only make several interfaces to control certain machines or applications in a slightly more playful way, but that was not the case at all. Playful Interfaces are the real deal.</p>
